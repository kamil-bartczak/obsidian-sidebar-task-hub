# Changelog

## 1.1.0

### New features

- **Tag pill badges** — `#tags` in task text are rendered as styled pill badges for quick visual scanning.
- **Subtask support** — indented tasks are displayed as subtasks with visual hierarchy. When a parent task is completed, children are shown with strikethrough styling.
- **Hide tasks & files** — right-click any task or file group to hide it. Hidden items are collected in a collapsible "Hidden" section at the bottom. Right-click to unhide.
- **Tag view** — new view mode groups all tasks by their `#tag` instead of by file/heading. Switch between views using the navbar icons.
- **Navbar** — icon toolbar at the top of the panel (like other Obsidian sidebars) with buttons for: files view, tags view, search toggle, and show-completed toggle.
- **Internationalization (i18n)** — all UI strings are translated into 14 languages: English, Polish, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Turkish. Language is auto-detected from the browser locale.
